<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Because I passed through this before, I can tell them there is still a future, there is still life, this is what I did and look where I am now.” – Rodah Nafula, Widow Champion</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thrown off their land and out of their homes, widows in rural Kenya are forced to live destitute with their children in markets or under trees. In Kenya, wives often live on the same compound with their husband’s families, and culture dictates that when your husband dies, you must be inherited by one of your husband’s brothers to be ‘cleansed’ and remain part of the family - even with the high rate of HIV in this region. More women are beginning to shun this practice, and are bearing the consequences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rodah Nafula suffered the consequences after her husband died 15 years ago, and her in-laws threw her and her three children off the land. After seven years living at the village market under inhumane conditions, Rodah connected with a local NGO, which helped her win back her land through a new community-based mediation program. Rodah then trained to be a “Widow Champion” to help others.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rodah is the narrative throughline of our film. Everyday, she deals with another widow, another threat, another in-law - all part of the story, as we walk with her through these different spaces. We will follow the case of Mary Atieno for over four years, the passage of time marked by the cycle of rice planting and harvesting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an immersive, fly-on-the-wall approach, we’ll interweave Mary’s story with other dramatic and emotional moments from other widows’ stories, to show how prevalent and complex the problem is, with Rodah as our lead.. We’ll also film Rodah as a mother to five children.</p>
