<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>OUR LAND, OUR FREEDOM tells the story of two extraordinary Kenyan women – a mother and daughter, Mukami and Wanjugu Kimathi, who share a mission to shine a light on the too-long-kept secret atrocities of British colonial rule in Kenya. Mukami was a freedom fighter in Kenya’s 1950s independence movement, and was married to its iconic leader, Dedan Kimathi. In 1957, Kimathi was hanged by the British, his body disposed of anonymously. Since then, Mukami has been searching for Kimathi’s remains, but becomes too frail to continue. Her daughter, Wanjugu, determined to fulfill her mother’s last wishes, takes over this quest.</p>

<p>Along her journey, Wanjugu learns of a buried history of colonial atrocities, including concentration camps, mass graves, and the vast theft of land that left hundreds of thousands of Kenyans destitute. This sparks a new mission for Wanjugu: she realizes she must demand compensation for the landless. Working closely with her mother, she transforms into a powerful leader in her own right, advocating for exposing past colonial crimes, while building a nation-wide grassroots movement for land resettlement.</p>
