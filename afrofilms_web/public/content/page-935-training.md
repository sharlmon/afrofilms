<h2>This is the CSR arm of Afrofilms</h2>
<p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">We use art to empower under-represented communities across the continent by offering workshops and skills training that they would otherwise not have access to.
We are the African partners and co-founders of the US registered non-profit 501(c)3 organization <a href="https://www.illtellyoumystory.com">https://www.illtellyoumystory.com</a> where we focus on training and empowering refugee girls through Writing, Film &amp; Photography.
We have also started a Pilot Project at the Nairobi West Prison in partnership with the Kenyan Prisons Services, to provide Creative and Technical Training for inmates - with a dream of creating pioneer ‘Film Clubs’ across all Kenyan prisons.</p>
